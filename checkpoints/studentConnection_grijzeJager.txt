Given the student's interests and favorites, I recommend introducing her to "Ranger's Apprentice" by John Flanagan. Here are some connections between the student and the story:

1. **Friendship:** In "Ranger's Apprentice," the bonds of friendship between Will, Halt, Horace, and other characters play a significant role in the story. The themes of loyalty, trust, and camaraderie resonate with the student, who enjoys books about friendship.

2. **Courage and Adventure:** The adventures and challenges faced by Will as he trains to become a Grijze Jager and protects the kingdom parallel the adventurous spirit of books like "Magic Treehouse." The theme of courage in the face of danger can inspire the student's own sense of bravery.

3. **Learning and Growth:** Just like the characters in the student's favorite books grow and learn through their experiences, Will undergoes a journey of learning, training, and personal growth throughout the series. This theme of personal development can resonate with the student's own learning experiences and growth.

4. **Animal Companionship:** The student may also enjoy the bond between Will and his companion, his horse Tug. Additionally, the cat Nemo may draw a connection to the animals present in the story, such as Abelard the dog and Shadow the horse.

By drawing these parallels and highlighting the themes of friendship, adventure, growth, and companionship in "Ranger's Apprentice," the student may find a new favorite book series that captures her imagination and love for fiction and friendship stories.
