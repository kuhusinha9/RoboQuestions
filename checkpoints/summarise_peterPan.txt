The story begins with the Darling family, consisting of Mr. and Mrs. Darling, their children Wendy, John, and Michael, and their dog Nana. The family lives at 14 and Mrs. Darling is a lovely lady with a romantic mind. Mr. Darling is a man who knows about stocks and shares. Wendy is the oldest child, followed by John and then Michael. The family is poor and Nana, a Newfoundland dog, serves as the children's nurse. 

One day, Mrs. Darling finds leaves in the nursery and Wendy suggests they might be from Peter Pan, a boy she believes visits her at night. Mrs. Darling dismisses the idea, but later finds a shadow that doesn't belong to anyone in the family. She stores it away, planning to show it to Mr. Darling later. 

One night, while the children are asleep and Nana is off duty, a boy named Peter Pan enters the nursery. Mrs. Darling wakes up and recognizes him as the boy from the children's minds. Peter is accompanied by a strange light and he escapes through the window when Nana returns and tries to attack him. Mrs. Darling finds Peter's shadow in Nana's mouth, which was snapped off when Nana closed the window on him. 

The next day, Mr. Darling ties Nana up in the yard, despite Mrs. Darling's warning about the boy she had seen. That night, after the parents leave for a party, Peter Pan returns to the nursery.
