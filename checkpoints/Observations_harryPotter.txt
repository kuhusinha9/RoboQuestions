1. "Did you know that Harry Potter also learned how to play a magical game called Quidditch at Hogwarts? It's a bit like designing your own game, eh? Have you ever tried to invent your own indoor Quidditch game?"

2. "Just like in your DnD adventures, Harry, Hermione, and Ron needed to work as a team to solve mysteries and overcome challenges. Could you see yourself and your friends on similar adventures?"

3. "Since you love science, I wonder if you'd enjoy learning about the different magical creatures in Harry Potter. From owls that deliver mail to dragons, the wizarding world is full of unexpected creatures."

4. "You and Hermione would probably get along well since you both love to learn new things! Can you imagine what it would be like to study with her for a Hogwarts exam, especially since one of your favourite subjects is also her favourite - science?"

5. "You know your cat, Kitty? Now think about her with larger, fluffier, and more magnificent wings. That's how a Hippogriff in Harry Potter looks, just a bit more intimidating. What do you think of Kitty being a magical creature?"
