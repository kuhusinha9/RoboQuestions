1. I see you've been reading Harry Potter, it's such a thrilling series, isn't it? It's packed full of magic and spells. Which spell would you love to have at your disposal? And why would you choose that particular spell? If we had a magic wand, we could possibly make the homework disappear, couldn't we? (Chuckle)
   - Follow-up question: Can you think of a situation where this spell would come in handy in real life?
   - Humour: How about a spell to make your vegetables disappear? 

2. I also noticed a science book in your backpack. Science is sort of magic of its own, isn't it? If you were a wizard or witch in Harry Potter's world, how would you combine that magic with your science knowledge? 
   - Follow-up question: What kind of magical scientific experiments would you like to conduct?
   - Humour: Would you try to invent a potion that makes homework answers appear?

3. The Harry Potter series is full of characters with their unique personalities and traits, isn't it? Just look at Crookshanks or Hedwig! By the way, how's your adorable cat Kitty doing? If Kitty had the power to talk, just like the magical creatures in Harry Potter, what do you think she'd say?
   - Follow-up question: Do you think Kitty would have some interesting story to tell?
   - Humour: Maybe Kitty would finally be able to tell you why she knocked that water glass over, wouldn't that be something?

4. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sure know how to face challenges, don't they? It's always exciting to see how they tackle different situations in the wizarding world. Speaking of which, imagine they played one of the games you designed or a round of DnD, who do you think would win, and why?
   - Follow-up question: How would their characteristics influence their gameplay? 
   - Humour: Would Ron lose points for being terrified of spiders?

5. The food in the Harry Potter books sounds both magical and delicious, doesn't it? If you had the opportunity to create a magical version of your favorite food, say fish and chips, what would it look like or taste like?
   - Follow-up question: Would you add any magical effects to your dish?
   - Humour: Don't make it taste like Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans, unless you want to risk tasting old gym socks!
