Observation: I've noticed that you love digging into a fun fantasy world, whether it's through designing your own games, setting off on a DnD quest, or losing yourself in a book like Harry Potter. Plus, you seem to have a real knack for science. I bet that helps you dream up all kinds of creative things in your game designing, just like J.K.Rowling did when creating the magical world of Hogwarts!

Question 1: We've both seen how Harry, Ron, and Hermione rely on each other to face the challenges and dangers in their quest to protect the Philosopher’s Stone. Do you think there are ways your DnD adventures are similar? Maybe you have a Hermione in your team who helps you out with tricky problems?

Joke 1: Imagine trying to play DnD in Hogwarts. The dice would probably start talking back to you!

Question 2: If I remember correctly, the Harry Potter series is chock-full of amazing magical creatures. If you could design your own, what would it look like, and what unique abilities would it have? Would it purr like Kitty or breathe fire?

Joke 2: If Kitty were a magical creature, do you think she'd appreciate a spell for unlimited fish and chips?

Question 3: Speaking of magic, if you could use any spell from Harry Potter in real life, which one would you choose and why? Would you conjure up an extra helping of fish and chips? 

Joke 3: Do you think there's a spell to finish your maths homework really quickly? Hogwarts could really use a 'Homework-Completo' spell, don't you think?

Question 4: Is there a character in Harry Potter or one of your other favourite books you relate with the most? Maybe there's a magical creature that reminds you of Kitty? 

Joke 4: Kitty might not like getting letters like Hedwig does – I think she’d prefer fish and chips deliveries!

Observation: I noticed you love science as well! Let's see how we can mix some potion brewing and science together.

Question 5: Let's imagine we're brewing up our own Philosopher’s Stone. We wouldn't use the forbidden magic for eternal life, but maybe for something fun like an endless fish and chips pot. What elements do you think we might need to conjure it up and why?

Joke 5: I think a key ingredient might be Chipium, the secret element that makes chips taste extra delicious!
