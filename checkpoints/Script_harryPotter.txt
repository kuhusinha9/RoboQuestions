1. If you could design a board game about Harry Potter, what kind of adventures would you include?
2. Can you think of a way science and magic could come together in a cool experiment at Hogwarts? 
3. Imagine if Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined your D&D session. What characters would you want them to play?
4. How do you think Harry and his friends felt when they first went to Hogwarts? Would you feel the same way if you began studying at a new, magical school?
5. If Kitty could talk and was a character in the Harry Potter series, what kind of adventures do you think she would have with the trio?
1. "I've noticed that just like you enjoy creating exciting games, Harry, Ron, and Hermione often found themselves trying to solve puzzles or mysteries. Do you think you could create a game inspired by their adventures at Hogwarts?"
2. "You and Harry both love exploring new worlds! His is full of magic and wonder at Hogwarts, while yours might be through reading new books or playing DnD. What's your favorite magical place you've read about or created in your games?"
3. "It's cool that your cat's name is Kitty! I guess you both - you and Hermione - love cats. Can you imagine Kitty having magical abilities like Hermione's cat, Crookshanks?"
4. "I see that you like fantasy stories - like Alice in Wonderland and Harry Potter - where characters explore strange, new worlds. Do you ever imagine what it would be like if you discovered a magical world, just like Alice or Harry did?"
5. "You know how you enjoy science, right? In a way, wizards and witches in the world of Harry Potter have their own rules and principles, sort of like science rules, but for magic. Might be fun to think what would happen if we mixed the two!"
