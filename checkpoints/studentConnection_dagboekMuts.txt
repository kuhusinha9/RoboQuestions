Based on the student's interests and favorites, I see a strong connection between her and the character Nikki Maxwell in the book we discussed. Both the student and Nikki:

- Enjoy reading fiction books about friendship, just like how Nikki's story focuses on themes of friendship and standing up for oneself.
  
- Have a love for books that involve characters overcoming challenges and finding their place, much like Nikki navigates the dynamics of her new school.

- Appreciate books that delve into self-acceptance and staying true to oneself, which are central themes in Nikki's journey throughout the story.
  
- Have a pet (the student's cat Nemo) similar to how Nikki's love for her diary reflects a safe space where she can be herself and express her thoughts.

These connections can help the student relate to and empathize with Nikki's experiences, making the story more engaging and meaningful for her. It can also spark discussions about friendship, self-discovery, and staying true to oneself, tying in with her favorite themes in books.
