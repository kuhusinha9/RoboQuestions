Given Ruth's interests in designing games and reading Fantasy books, they might be drawn to stories about overcoming challenges, exploring fantastical worlds, and using creativity to navigate through difficult situations. Perhaps Ruth could relate to Bram's struggles in the story as they both face challenges and find ways to cope with their circumstances creatively. Additionally, Ruth's love for their cat Kitty might resonate with the themes of friendship and companionship present in the story.
