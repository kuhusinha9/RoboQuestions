Ruth's interest in designing games and reading Fantasy books align with Tom's adventurous spirit in "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer." Tom's imagination and love for play mirror Ruth's creativity in designing games, and his escapades in the story parallel the fantastical adventures Ruth might encounter in their books.

Additionally, the presence of Ruth's cat, Kitty, resonates with the old lady searching for Tom and finding the cat under the bed. This shared pet connection adds a charming similarity between Ruth and the story's characters.
