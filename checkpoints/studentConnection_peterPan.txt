Ruth's interests in designing games, reading fantasy books, and having a pet cat named Kitty draw interesting parallels with the characters and themes in the story of Peter Pan. Here are some connections:

1. **Imagination and Creativity**: Ruth's love for designing games reflects a strong imagination and creativity, similar to how the Darling children in Peter Pan are drawn into a world of fantasy and make-believe with Peter Pan.

2. **Fantasy and Adventure**: Ruth's enjoyment of reading fantasy books aligns with the fantastical elements of Peter Pan, where characters embark on adventurous journeys to magical lands like Neverland.

3. **Animal Companions**: Just like Ruth's cat Kitty, Nana the dog serves as a beloved animal companion in the Darling family. Pets play a significant role in both Ruth's and the Darling children's lives, offering companionship and comfort.

4. **Childlike Wonder**: Ruth's age of 9 indicates a stage of childhood wonder and curiosity, much like Wendy, John, and Michael Darling who experience the magic and excitement brought by Peter Pan and his whimsical world.

These common interests and themes between Ruth and the characters in Peter Pan highlight the universal appeal of imagination, fantasy, and the joy of exploring new and magical worlds, whether through books, games, or the adventures of beloved characters.
