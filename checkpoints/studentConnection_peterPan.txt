Robert resembles Michael from the Darling family in the story of Peter Pan. Both Robert and Michael are young boys who have a sibling (Thijs for Robert, and Wendy and John for Michael). Both children also have a pet - Goldie the fish for Robert and Nana the dog for Michael. Additionally, Michael's adventurous spirit and Robert's interest in painting and reading graphic novels show a common love for creativity and imagination. Just as Peter Pan brings magic and adventure into the lives of the Darling children, the interests and dynamics in Robert's family may mirror some aspects of the story's themes of imagination, family relationships, and adventure.
