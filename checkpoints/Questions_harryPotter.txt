4. You know, in DnD we come across difficult challenges, much like the ones Harry, Ron, and Hermione face in the story. Can you think of a time when you had to work together with friends to solve a problem in DnD? How was it similar or different to the situations in Harry Potter?
5. Imagine you are in a magical science class at Hogwarts. What magical experiment would you want to conduct?
