1. Why don't you ever see Harry Potter drinking tea? Because it might Slytherin!
2. Did you hear about the spell for finding out how heavy a red hot chili pepper is? It's called "give-it-a-weigh, give-it-a-weigh, give-it-a-weigh now!"
3. I heard you like science... So here's one: Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything. Like magic in Harry Potter, right?
4. What do you call a wizard who just won a game of Quidditch? A flying sorcerer!
5.  How does Harry Potter get down a hill? Walking... JK, Rowling!
6. Noticed you like fish 'n chips. You know, even Hogwarts had a Great Lake. Unfortunately, they never mentioned any Great Chips.
7. How is Potions Class like your favourite subject, Science? Both require precise measurements, or boom, you might just turn into a cat like Hermione!
8. What's Kitty's favourite spell in Harry Potter? "Furry-ous Felix" because it turns any situation into a purr-fect one!
9. Let's imagine a Hogwarts House for gamers. Its symbol could be a D&D dice, and its members would be good at strategy just like when Harry, Ron, and Hermione played wizard's chess!
10. You love Alice in Wonderland and Harry Potter, both have crazy tea parties. Mad Hatter's tea time or Dumbledore's meeting with the Dursleys, which one's weirder?
