Given the student's interests in football, swimming, and math, along with having a dog named Goldie and enjoying eating stamppot, we can connect these aspects to the story of "Niek de Groot" by Lincoln Peirce in the following ways:

1. **Sports and Competition**: Just like the student enjoys football and swimming, Niek de Groot faces challenges and competitions in the school setting, often dealing with rivals like Gina. The competitive nature seen in both sports and school activities can resonate with the student's own experiences.

2. **Problem-solving and Mysteries**: Since the student enjoys books about solving mysteries like those in "Secret Seven" and "Famous Five", they might find Niek's journey in tackling challenges and overcoming obstacles relatable. Niek's creative problem-solving skills and humor in the face of difficulties could appeal to the student's love for solving mysteries.

3. **Dog Companion**: The student and Niek share the experience of having a loyal companion, with the student having a dog named Goldie. Niek's friendship with Teddy in the story mirrors the student's bond with Goldie, showcasing the importance of supportive friendships and companionship in both their lives.

4. **Favorite Subject Math**: While the student's favorite subject is math, Niek's passion for drawing and his dream of becoming a cartoonist highlight the importance of pursuing one's interests and strengths. Niek's dedication to his passion can resonate with the student's enthusiasm for math, emphasizing the value of following one's passions.

By drawing parallels between the student's personal interests and the themes and characters in the story of "Niek de Groot", we can help create a meaningful connection that enhances the student's engagement with the book and fosters a deeper appreciation for the story's messages of perseverance, friendship, and pursuing one's dreams.
