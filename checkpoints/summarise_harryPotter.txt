"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" is the first book in the Harry Potter series written by J.K. Rowling. The story begins with Harry Potter, a young boy who lives with his abusive relatives, the Dursleys, after the death of his parents. On his 11th birthday, Harry discovers that he is a wizard when he receives an invitation to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 

At Hogwarts, Harry befriends Hermione Granger, a muggle-born witch with a knack for spells, and Ron Weasley, a pure-blood wizard from a large, loving but poor family. Harry also meets the stern but fair headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, and the malevolent potions master, Severus Snape. 

Harry learns that he is famous in the wizarding world as the only person to have survived an attack by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who killed his parents and attempted to kill him when he was a baby. This attack left Harry with a distinctive lightning-shaped scar on his forehead.

Throughout the school year, Harry, Ron, and Hermione begin to unravel the mystery of the Philosopher's Stone, a magical artifact with the power to grant immortality, which is being hidden inside Hogwarts. They suspect that someone is trying to steal the stone for Voldemort, who they believe is still alive but in a weakened state.

The trio faces various challenges, including a giant three-headed dog, a deadly plant known as Devil's Snare, a life-sized game of wizard's chess, and a mirror that shows one's deepest desires. In the climax, Harry confronts Professor Quirrell, who has been possessed by Voldemort. Quirrell tries to use Harry to get the Philosopher's Stone, but Harry's touch causes Quirrell to turn to dust, and Voldemort's spirit flees.

In the end, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are hailed as heroes. Harry returns to the Dursleys for the summer, but with the knowledge that he has found a place where he truly belongs and friends who care about him, he is no longer just the boy under the stairs.
